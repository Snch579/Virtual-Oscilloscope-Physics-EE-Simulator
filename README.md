# Virtual-Oscilloscope-Physics-EE-Simulator
Virtual oscilloscope built with Python, DearPyGui, and NumPy. Simulates sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth signals with adjustable frequency, amplitude, offset, noise, and triggers. Includes live plotting, cursors, and real-time signal measurements.

Features:
  Simulates various waveforms: Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth
  Adjustable frequency, amplitude, offset, and noise
  Trigger control with rising or falling edge detection
  Vertical and horizontal scaling (time/div and volts/div)
  Interactive voltage and time cursors with delta measurements
  Real-time calculation of peak-to-peak voltage, RMS voltage, average voltage, frequency, and cursor differences
  Fully interactive GUI with live plot updates

Technologies Used:
  Python 3.x
  DearPyGui for GUI and real-time plotting
  NumPy for signal processing and analysis

How to Run:
  Install dependencies:
    pip install dearpygui numpy
    
  Run the simulator:
    python oscilloscope.py

Purpose:
  Real-time signal processing
  GUI programming in Python
  Oscilloscope principles and visualization
  Interactive user controls for electrical signal analysis
  It was developed as a learning and portfolio project for showcasing practical applications of programming in the context of electrical engineering concepts.
